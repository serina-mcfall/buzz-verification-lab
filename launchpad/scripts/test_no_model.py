"""The no-model property, asserted by AST — launchpad-26/buzz#116.

The issue requires that the pre-flight make no model call. This module proves it
by parsing the source and comparing every imported module name against an
allowlist **written here**, so any new import fails by default rather than only
the handful someone thought to name in a pattern.

Why this is not a grep
======================

A grep reports every occurrence and leaves a human to sort the legitimate hits
from the real ones. That is not a check that can fail. An allowlist inverts the
burden: the check goes red on an import nobody anticipated.

Three ways an import evades a naive scan, all closed here
=========================================================

**Traverse with ``ast.walk``, not ``tree.body``.** ``tree.body`` sees only
top-level statements, so an ``import requests`` inside a function body is
invisible to it. :meth:`Traversal.test_a_top_level_scan_misses_a_nested_import`
demonstrates the difference on a sample rather than asserting it.

**Collect ``Call`` nodes too.** ``importlib.import_module("openai")`` is a Call,
never an Import — an import-name scan reports it as absent. One line, and the
no-model rule is broken outright while every import-based check stays green.

**``__import__("openai")`` needs no import statement at all**, so only the
call-node rule can see it.

This module deliberately **does not import** the modules it checks. It reads
their source and parses it. An import-hygiene check that imports its subject
cannot report on a subject whose new import is not installed: it dies at import
time, and a suite that is red because a module could not load is not evidence
that this check works. Keeping it source-only is what lets
``mutation_harness.py`` inject ``import openai`` and show *this* control turning
red.
